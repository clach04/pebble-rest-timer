# Rest Pebble App

I built this app for my own use in the gym, for rest intervals.

There's three simple options and the app includes a configuration screen available from Pebble phone app allowing you to control the rest interval pre-sets.

Features:

- Three timers: 60 seconds, 90 seconds, 120 seconds (screen 1)
- Vibrate on timer done
- When counting down, restarting is mapped to the same buttons, so no extra menus or display required (screen 2)
- Once the timer is complete, an overrun counter starts so if you want a cheeky extra 30 seconds
- Configurable timers
- Animation free!

Currently only available to be installed in development mode - coming to the Pebble "store" soon.

If you want to build it yourself, I highly recommend using [cloudpebble.net](https://cloudpebble.net).

Yes, you can also use this for [Pomodoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)!
