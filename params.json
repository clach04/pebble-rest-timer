{"name":"Rest","tagline":"Super simple Pebble app for rest intervals (like in the gym)","body":"# Rest Pebble App\r\n\r\nI built this app for my own use in the gym, for rest intervals.\r\n\r\nCurrently there's only 3 options - but the code is written so that a configuration screen will be added to the Pebble phone app allowing you to control the rest interval pre-sets.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Three predefined timers: 60 seconds, 90 seconds, 120 seconds (screen 1)\r\n- Vibrate on timer done\r\n- When counting down, restarting is mapped to the same buttons, so no extra menus or display required (screen 2)\r\n- Once the timer is complete, an overrun counter starts so if you want a cheeky extra 30 seconds\r\n- Animation free!\r\n\r\n![Watch screens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/remy/rest/master/screenshots/states.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently only available to be installed in development mode - coming to the Pebble \"store\" soon.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it yourself, I highly recommend using [cloudpebble.net](https://cloudpebble.net).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Configuration (on Pebble phone) to define: pre-set timers and theme\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
